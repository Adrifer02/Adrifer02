## About Me
I am a multilingual professional, fluent in Spanish, French, English, and Portuguese. I hold a degree in French Philology and a Master's in Creative and Humanistic Translation. My career has given me the opportunity to work in diverse fields, from teaching Spanish and French in Paris to working as a translator and business intelligence specialist in Valencia. Currently, I’m based in Lisbon.

At the beginning of this year, I decided to make a career shift, focusing on data analysis. Since then, I’ve been studying Python, SQL, Tableau, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to expand my skill set and explore new opportunities in this exciting field.
